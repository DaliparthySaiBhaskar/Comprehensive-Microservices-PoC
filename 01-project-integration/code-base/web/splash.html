    <h3>Welcome to Robot Shop Sandbox</h3>
    <p>
    Stan's Robot Shop was originally developed by Instana (now part of IBM) to demonstrate their APM (Application Performance Management) tool. Built with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, Stan's Robot Shop provides a comprehensive environment for exploring cloud-native architectures and DevOps best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
    Comprehensive-Microservices-PoC is my customized adaptation of Stan's Robot Shop, serving as a sandbox environment to explore, experiment, and demonstrate real-world DevOps practices, cloud-native architectures, and GitOps workflows with production-level standards.
    This simple microservices ecommerce application has been built using various technologies:
    <ul>
        <li>Frontend Service: Nginx</li>
        <li>Microservices: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, PHP</li>
        <li>Data Storage: MongoDB, Redis, MySQL</li>
        <li>Messaging: RabbitMQ</li>
        <li>CI/CD & GitOps: Jenkins, Argo CD</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Explore this microservices-based system with production-level standards to understand how cloud-native applications function in modern, scalable environments.
